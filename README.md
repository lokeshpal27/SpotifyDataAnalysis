# Spotify Data Analysis Project

## Aim

The aim of this project is to analyze the Spotify dataset and find various insights such as the most popular genre and how song duration affects popularity.

## Dataset

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. It contained information about various songs, such as their name, artist, duration, popularity, genre, and more. The initial dataset was very noisy, so we used Python and Pandas to clean it up.

## Technology Used

We used Python and Pandas to clean the dataset and perform various operations on it. We also used Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Cleaning the Data

We used Pandas to clean the raw data. The cleaning process included removing duplicates, filling missing values, and transforming the data to ensure consistency.

## Analyzing the Data

We performed various operations on the cleaned data to get insights such as:

- The most popular genres on Spotify

## Visualization

We created various visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to better understand the data and provide insights.

## Conclusion

Through our analysis, we discovered various insights, such as the most popular genre on Spotify and how song duration affects popularity. We hope that our findings will be useful to anyone interested in understanding the music industry and its trends.

## Future Work

In the future, we plan to expand our analysis to include more datasets and identify more insights. We also plan to improve the data cleaning process to automate and make it more efficient.
